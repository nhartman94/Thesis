\caption{ A summary of the analysis selection. Events are required to pass the common preselection criteria to be included in either the ggF or VBF signal regions. Events which then pass the VBF selection are included in that signal region; those which fail any of the VBF selection criteria are considered for the ggF signal region instead. Events in both signal regions then must pass the additional common selection criteria. Lastly, a selection on \deta is applied to events in the ggF signal region. }
