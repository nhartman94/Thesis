%Control Region (CR) & Events with $\Xhh > 1.6$ and within the circle defined by: $\sqrt{ \left(m_{\PH1} - 1.05 \cdot \SI{124}{\GeV}\right)^2 +  \left(m_{\PH2} - 1.05 \cdot \SI{117}{\GeV}\right)^2 } = \SI{45}{\GeV} $   & Background estimation (ggF and VBF) \\
Signal Region (SR) & Events with $\Xhh < 1.6$    & Signal Region definition in the $m_{\PH1}$-$m_{\PH2}$ plane \\

Control Region (CR) & Events with $\Xhh > 1.6$ and $R_{\text{CR}}<45$   & Control Region definition in the $m_{\PH1}$-$m_{\PH2}$ plane for background estimation (ggF and VBF) \\

Shifted validation regions & Shift the center of the SR in the $m_{\PH1}$-$m_{\PH2}$ plane to avoid overlap with the nominal SR & Background estimation validation (ggF only) \\
