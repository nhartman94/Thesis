\section{Forward Detectors}
The forward detector at ATLAS covers pseudorapidities $|\eta| > 8.2$, and has three sub-systems: two to measure the luminosity and the last one for heavy--ion studies conducted when the collider accelerates with lead nuclei at $\sqrt{s}=5$~TeV.
LUCID (LUminosity measurement using Cerenkov Integrating Detector) is located $\pm 17$m from the interaction point, and is the primary online luminosity detector for ATLAS.
ALFA (Absolute Luminosity For ATLAS) is located $\pm$240~m, and uses scintillating fibers as another measure for the luminosity, with these fibers extending as a millimeter from the beam pipe.
Finally, ZDZ (Zero-Degree Calorimeter) lies $\pm 140$ and has alternating layers of quartz rods and tungsten plates for detecting neutral particles at pseudorapities $|\eta| > 8.2$ \cite{ATLAS_long}.
