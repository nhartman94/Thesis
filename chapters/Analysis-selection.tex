% I might want to describe the offline jet and b-tagging cuts before the trigger section?
Jets are separated into two groups based on their kinematics: 
\begin{description}
	\item[\textit{Central} jets:] $|\eta| < 2.5,\ \pt \ge 40\ \GeV$ -  these jets are used for triggering and will form  Higgs-candidates;
	\item[\textit{Forward} jets:] $|\eta| \ge 2.5,\ \pt \ge 30\ \GeV$ - these extra jets are used to improve the acceptance of jets produced in the vector boson fusion production process.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{\Pqb-jets Selection}
\label{sec:sel-btag}

In order to maximize sensitivity, events are selected and categorized based on the number of \Pqb-tagged \textit{central} jets. 
The \Pqb-tagging algorithm used, DL1r, is described in \Sect{\ref{subsec:ftag}}. 

\paragraph{Ordering and selection} For the jets that form our Higgs Candidates, we take the four leading \Pqb-tagged jets. In events with less than four \Pqb-jets, the extra jets are selected as the highest $p_T$ jets from the pool of \textit{central} jets which failed the initial \Pqb-tag requirement.

\paragraph{\Pqb-tag Requirements} The \Pqb-tag selection for ggF and VBF signals is to require \textbf{at least 4 central jets with DL1r 77\% WP}. Events with two \bjets are classified as 2b events and are used for deriving the data-driven background estimate described in \Sect{\ref{sec:bkgdestimation}}. We also define a systematic on our background estimation using events with 3 \Pqb-tags, and the corresponding \Pqb-tag categories used in this analysis are summarized in table \ref{tab:b-tag-cat}.
