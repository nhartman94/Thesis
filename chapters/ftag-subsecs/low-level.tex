\section{Low level taggers}

There are two types of low-level algorithms that are employed by the 

While the IP-based algorithms take input a set of tracks and just use the individual track features (such as IPs) to classify the jet, the vertexing-based algorithms (SV1 and JF) involve an iterative approach to reconstruct the topology of the displayed decay.


The outlining of this section is as follows: I first 

Although the RNNIP algorithm was proposed before developing my thesis, a key contribution of my thesis work was continuing to optimize this develop
