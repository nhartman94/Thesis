\section{Background validation}
\label{sec:bkg-val-regns}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Smth about inverting \emph{all} of the cuts?
	\item Since the focus of my thesis was the ggF analysis and , I will share the results from that. Also, since the VBF analysis is so statistically dominated, it was easier to see closure just because the stats were so much lower.
	\item Emphasize how each of these procedures results in retraining all of the NNs for the bootstrap and CR1,2 shape difference
	\item Maybe emphasize how the 3b1f systematic is not included in these studies
\end{itemize}
