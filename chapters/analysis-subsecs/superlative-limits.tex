Just the ggF selection, not relevant

%\Fig{\ref{fig:kl-scan}} shows the \kl scans for the ggF selection with the \Xhh and \deta categorization.  The corresponding obs.\ (exp.) \kl constraint from the ggF channel is $[-4.5, 13.3]$ ($[-5.0, 12.0]$) and the observed (expected) upper limit that is set on the SM ggF signal strength, including the cross section uncertainty from theory calculations, is 5.73 (8.28).
