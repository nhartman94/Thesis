\subsection{Modeling variables: HH verses Higgs Candidate kinematics}
\label{app:modeling-vars}

\textbf{Brief summmary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Study with the pairAGraph pairing alg and older analysis selection
	\item Also considering
	\item It was easier to pick up subtle features fo the $|\cos \theta^*|$ modeling when modeling the HC kinematics directly.
\end{itemize}
