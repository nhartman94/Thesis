\section{Interpolation model}
\label{sec:interp-models}

%Quick overview of how we want to model a sampling distribution and we're posing the problem with ancestral sampling.

The problem we seek to set up seeks to pose this as an interpolation problem by setting up the prediction of the joint probability distribution of over the HH kinematics and the Higgs candidate masses by setting this up as a hierarchical modeling problem and decomposing the joint as shown in \Eq{eq:joint-HH}. The conditional probability$p(m_{hh}, \Delta \eta_{HH} m_{h1}, m_{h2}) $ is modeled with a conditional normalizing flow, while the $p (m_{h1}, m_{h2})$ is fit with a Gaussian process. 

\begin{equation}
    p(\text{event kinematics}, m_{h1}, m_{h2}) = p(\text{event kinematics} | m_{h1}, m_{h2}) p (m_{h1}, m_{h2})
    \label{eq:joint-HH}
\end{equation}
