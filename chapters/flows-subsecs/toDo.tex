\section{To do}
\label{app:toDo}


\textbf{Actually needed}
\begin{itemize}
	\item MK: Refs from LFI literature
	\item RTdL: Intro
	\item Write up the GP section
	\item Fill in citations
	\item Add the people contributions list
	\item Fill in abstract
\end{itemize}


\textbf{not necessary, but possibly nice next steps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compare the CR{1,2} predictions (basically a \emph{closure test})
    \item Show the 4b limit with these systematics included?
    \item Justification for the \# of trainings and samples that I'm drawing?
    \item Plot of the non-closures for all of the validation regions
    
\end{itemize}
