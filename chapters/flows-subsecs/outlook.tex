How could this help?

 \begin{itemize}
     \item Better modeling or control of the systematics
     \item As we are \emph{explicitly} modelling all of the correlations, we can check that we got the modeling correct, might open us up to using a BDT based discriminant
     \item Could let us use the 3b1l category again (this is \emph{way} too 3b specific to put in the flows paper though).
     \item \emph{Opens us up to using 3b triggers + lowering the thresholds!!}
 \end{itemize}
