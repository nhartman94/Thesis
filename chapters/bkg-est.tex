\chapter{Background estimation}

Although the 4b final state is tantalizingly attractive because of the highest branching ratio fraction for the signal,  the fully hadronic final state also means that we have larger backgrounds to cope with. QCD backgrounds are notoriously difficult to simulate from first principles, so we need can't rely on simulation to estimate our background estimate, and instead need to rely on data driven methods to form an estimate of the background in a (blinded) signal region.

%As Table X shows...
%\hl{It would be really nice to have a table to show the S / B yields for the main HH channels!! (or at least the 3 main ones!)}
% The SLT channel of bbtau tau kind of fucks this up - so I'm going to need to think about how to emphasize this point better!

There are two main proportions of background that we have: QCD and $t\bar{t}$, with the estimated relative proportions shown in \Tab{\ref{tab:ttbar-percent-ggF-4b}} and \ref{tab:ttbar-percent-VBF} for ggF and VBF, respectively. Since the $t\bar{t}$ proportion is only 10\% of the background, our background estimate is derived inclusively for the QCD and $\tbar{t}$ proportions.

The key idea of the background estimate is to reweight the distributions in a lower \Pqb-tag region into a higher \Pqb-tag region by deriving these reweighting maps in dedicated control regions. The task of accurately estimating this background and assigning an appropriate error bar is the key to this analysis, and is the focus of this chapter. \Sect{\ref{sec:rw-overview}} overviews the nominal background estimate strategy, while \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg-val-plots}} shows some of the validation plots that the method is working. the errors that we assign to the nominal estimate are shown in \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg-systs}} and the tests of the methodology in different validation regions are discussed in \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg-val-regns}}
