Although the 4b final state is tantalizingly attractive because of the highest \HH branching ratio,  the fully hadronic final state also means dealing with larger backgrounds. This is illustrated in \Fig{\ref{fig:hh-chan-breakdown}} which shows a comparison between the signal and backgrounds for the three most sensitive HH channels: $bb\gamma\gamma$, $bb\tau\tau$, and $4b$, and demonstrates the large anticipated backgrounds with the 4b final state.

The sheer number of background events is not the only issue. Our dominant background comes from QCD processes initiated that are notoriously difficult to simulate from first principles, so we can't rely on Monte Carlo for our background, and instead rely on data-driven methods to estimate the background in a (blinded) signal region.

For this heuristic comparison, a loose cut on the $bb\tau\tau$ MVA discriminants was used to mimic the $bb\gamma\gamma$ BDT categories.}

% It would be nice to include a plot showing how simulation doesn't do a good job estimating our data
% Also - it would be nice to have illlustration of what QCD processes can "fake" these backgrounds 
% -> I think Todd had a useful paper related to this??

Another background that we have is $t\bar{t}$, which accounts for $\approx 10\%$ of the background, with proportions relative o the total background shown in \Tab{\ref{tab:ttbar-percent-ggF-4b}} and \ref{tab:ttbar-percent-VBF} for ggF and VBF, respectively. Since this a small contribution, our background estimate is derived inclusively for QCD and $\tbar{t}$ proportions, although as part of this thesis work \App{\ref{app:ttbar-rw}} shows studies for how we can model this contribution separately in the reweighting in future analysis iterations.

The key idea of the background estimate used in this analysis is to reweight the distributions in a lower \Pqb-tag region into a higher \Pqb-tag region by deriving these reweighting maps in dedicated control regions. The task of accurately estimating this background and assigning an appropriate error bar is the key to this analysis -- and is the focus of this chapter. 
\Sect{\ref{sec:rw-overview}} overviews the nominal background estimate strategy, while \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg-val-plots}} shows some of the validation plots that the method is working. the errors that we assign to the nominal estimate are shown in \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg-systs}} and the tests of the methodology in different validation regions are discussed in \Sect{\ref{sec:bkg-val-regns}}

Since the different \Pqb-tagging regions define different control regions for defining the background estimate or assessing a systematic, in \Tab{\ref{tab:b-tag-cat}} we provide a table of the different \Pqb-tag regions that will be discussed here.
