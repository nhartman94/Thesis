\chapter{Event Reconstruction}

The task of event reconstruction involves taking electronic read out signals from the 100 million sensors in the detector and to reconstruct objects that can serve as proxies to the physics observables (i.e, $b$-quarks) % from a HIggs decay)
that to use in high-level physics analysis.
Since the LHC collides protons, %, three quarks held together by gluons
we produce lots of quarks and gluons in the final state, with an example of the signature these particles produce in the detector shown in \Fig{\ref{fig:tracks-clusters-annotated}}.

Since this thesis deals with an analysis with an all-hadronic final states, these are the key input objects for the analysis and for my work in \Pqb-tagging, so in this chapter we focus on the reconstruction of these types of events.
We include this graphic here, because it nicely demonstrates the outline for this chapter
The charged particle trajectories in the inner detector form a set of tracks, and will be described in \Sect{\ref{sec:tracks}}.
The tracks that originate from the same location are then reconstructed into vertices, as described in \Sect{\ref{sec:vertices}}.
The unsupervised learning algorithms that get reconstructs the quark and gluon decay products into the ``jets'' are described in \Sect{\ref{sec:jets}}.
Finally, we conclude with the reconstruction muon tracks in \Sect{\ref{sec:muons}}.

% Note - if I include this, I \emph{know} that Pat will ask me about the details, so I should make sure I understand the color coding, etc.

\section{Muons}
\label{sec:muons}

Def useful for muon in jet + pt reco correction!!
%Also - for describing the DL1rmu tagger .

%\subsection{Pileup suppression}
%\subsection{Event cleaning}
% I'm tempted to talk about these, but since they're not directly related 
% to the core contributions of my thesis work, I'm going to skip it.
% Oh - I should j add what I put in the int note!!
